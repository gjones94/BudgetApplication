This is a family friendly budget app that I was inspired to make after getting married to help my wife and I track our monthly finances.
We are both hesitant to connect our financial institutions to any 3rd party apps, and so I decided to make an app that we can track our expenses. Although it
uses manual entry to avoid a direct connection to our bank, it is quite handy at helping us customize a budget and use custom expense categories and a dashboard for financial projections

**Special Note**<br>
This application has a migration that will automatically roll forward recurring incomes and fixed costs each month. This will happen automatically at the startup of the application.
